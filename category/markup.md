<h1>Hobbies</h1>
Outside of work you can find me watching or playing rugby, talking about F1, playing video games (mostly League of Legends), Poker, or trying out stuff in some open machine learning competitions.  
I also like to follow the news around cyber security and do some basic Capture the flag challenges from time to time.
